# Building-A-LoRaWAN-Network
A tutorial covering all aspects of building a LoRaWAN network including a gateway, node and server.

## Build a LoRaWAN Gateway

The LoRaWAN gateway build in this tutorial very closely follows the tutorial presented by [The Things Network Zurich](https://github.com/ttn-zh "The Things Network Zurich"), specifically, their [iC880a-gateway repository](https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway/tree/spi "The Things Network Zurich ic880a-gateway SPI").

### Gateway Parts

A Do-It-Yourself (DIY) approach was taken to build the LoRaWAN gateway documented in this project. This solution involved using a LoRa capable board (iC880a) and connecting it to a host computer (Raspberry Pi). The following parts were sourced to build the LoRa gateway:

### Install Raspbian Lite on the Raspberry Pi

We need an Operating System for the Raspberry Pi. We are going to use "Raspbian Jessie Lite" - a minimal operating system based on Debian Jessie (version 8) without an X Windows system (graphical interface). This provides a lightweight operating system to run the gateway. Specific details of the Raspbian version used in this project are as follows:

+ Version: April 2017
+ Release date: 2017-04-10
+ Kernel version: 4.4
+ SHA-1: c24a4c7dd1a5957f303193fee712d0d2c0c6372d
+ [Raspbery Pi download page](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ "Download Raspbian for Raspberry Pi") 

Linux, specifically Ubuntu 16.04-2, was used to prepare the micro SD card for the Raspberry Pi. Although instructions are provided, it is reccommended to follow the [official documented procedure](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md, "Installing Operating System Images on Linux"). However, to be thorough, the following steps were performed in this project.

The first step was to unzip the Raspbian Jessie Lite download. This was achieved with the following command:

```bash
unzip 2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.zip
```

You should now have a .img file available. We need to determine where the micro SD card is located in order to write the .img file to. Use the df command to find the micro SD card:

```bash
df -h
```

If you are having trouble identifying your micro SD card, try the following steps:

+ Unplug the micro SD card
+ Run the df -h command
+ Plug in the micro SD card
+ Run the df -h command
+ Comapre the output from both commands, and determine the new device

In the preceeding discussion, my micro SD card was identified as mmcblk0. Specifically, one partition was discovered on /dev/mmcblk0p1. This partition needs to be unmounted to write the Raspbian image to the card:

```bash
umount /dev/mmcblk0p1
```

Now write the extracted Raspbian image (.img file) to the micro SD card.

```bash
sudo dd bs=4M if=2017-04-10-raspbian-jessie-lite.img of=/dev/mmcblk0
```

Finally, flush the cache to ensure all data is written:

```bash
sync
```

NOTE: We could easily enable Secure Shell (SSH) on the Raspberry Pi now by adding a folder called "SSH" to the boot folder in the micro SD card. However, I set up SSH later using the raspi-config tool.

All done installing Raspbian Lite. Insert the micro SD card into the Raspberry Pi.

### Connecting the ic880a to the Raspberry Pi

Now that the Raspberry Pi is installed we should connect the iC880a board to the Raspberry Pi.

Firstly, connect the antenna pigtail to the iC880a board. The U.FL connector should easily "clip" into the adapter on the iC880a board. Check the beofe and after picture below for more information on antenna location.

INSERT: Photo of antenna connector, before and after

Next, attach the antenna to the SMA connector on the pigtail. The antenna pigtail we purchased from IMST is a U.FL to SMA female. 

WARNING: Never power up the device without connecting the antenna!

Lastly, we need to connect the iC880a to the Raspberry Pi using our 7 female jumper cables. The following table documents the required connections between the devices.

| iC880a pin | Description | RaspPi pin |
|:----------:|:-----------:|:----------:|
|     21     |  Supply 5V  |      2     |
|     22     |     GND     |      6     |
|     13     |    Reset    |     22     |
|     14     |   SPI CLK   |     23     |
|     15     |     MISO    |     21     |
|     16     |     MOSI    |     19     |
|     17     |     NSS     |     24     |

We are now ready to power on the Raspberry Pi and configure our gateway.

NOTE: There are a variety of methods to connect the Raspberry Pi to the iC880a board. Specifically, there are some backplane boards which remove the need for jumper cables. This method is highly recommended, especially when deploying the gateway. The following web sites sell backplanes compadible with the Raspberry Pi and the iC880a board:

+ https://github.com/ch2i/iC880A-Raspberry-PI
+ https://www.tindie.com/stores/gnz/ and https://github.com/gonzalocasas/ic880a-backplane

### Configuring the Raspberry Pi

Connect the Raspberry Pi to an Ethernet cable on the local network

```bash
ssh pi@raspberrypi.local
```

or, where 192.168.1.10 is the IP of the Raspberry Pi:

```bash
ssh pi@192.168.1.10
```

The default username and password for a fresh Raspbian Lite install is:

+ username: pi
+ password: raspberry

We should change these values now (better security practices). In the following examples, the username selected was "ttn-user", however, you can select any username.

pi@raspberrypi~#: sudo adduser ttn-user

You will be prompted to enter the details of the new user including a password and full name etc.

Now, add the new user to the sudoers group so that they can run commands as using the sudo prefix.

```bash
sudo adduser ttn-user sudo
```

We must enable SPI on the Raspbian install. Additionally, we should also expand the filesystem to the entire micro SD card. To achieve both of these, we can use raspi-config utility, as described below:

```bash
sudo raspi-config
```

Select > [5] Interfacing options
Select > P4 SPI

Also, expand the file system:

Select > [7] Advanced options -> A1 Expand filesystem

You will be asked to reboot after exiting the raspi-config utility, select yes to reboot. Or manually reboot using:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

When the Raspberry Pi reboots, login with the new credentials (the username and password that you just created). Now, elete the default "pi" user (good security practice) using the following command:

```bash
sudo userdel -rf pi
```

Perform an update on the device and upgrade any packages using the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

Now, install the git package which allows us to download the gateway software from the git repository:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git
```

Now comes the part where we download and install the software required to operated the iC880a board, capture LoRa packets and forward the packets to a backend server. Luckily for us, there is a dedicated GitHub repository available which provides a simple script to install each software components required.

Clone the repository from The Things Network Zurich. Make sure to clone the "spi" branch:

```bash
git clone -b spi https://github.com/ttn-zh/ic880a-gateway.git ~/ic880a-gateway
```

Change to the directory where we downloaded the software:

```bash
cd ~/ic880a-gateway
```

And, finally, run the software using the following command:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh spi
```

Ok, so that was pretty simple. But what does this install script actually do? We will discuss each component below.

+ Firstly, the script updates the git repository
+ The scripts then attempts to set the gateway EUI (gateway ID) using the devices (Raspberry Pi's) MAC address
+ Then the hostname of the Raspberry Pi is set (default of "ttn-gateway")
+ WiringPi is removed (if installed)
+ All remaining software is then installed in: /opt/ttn-gateway/
+ Clones the latest "lora_gateway" software from https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/lora_gateway.git
+ Builds the packet forwarder software from https://github.com/TheThingsNetwork/packet_forwarder.git
+ Writes symbolic links for packet forwarder and it's configuration
+ Starts the packet forwarder as a service
+ Reboots

Use the test tool:

```bash
ttn-user@ttn-gateway:~ $ sudo /opt/ttn-gateway/lora_gateway/util_tx_test/util_tx_test -f 868 -r 1257
Sending -1 packets on 868000000 Hz (BW 125 kHz, SF 10, CR 1, 16 bytes payload, 8 symbols preamble) at 14 dBm, with 1000 ms between each
INFO: concentrator started, packet can be sent
Sending packet number 1 ...OK
Sending packet number 2 ...OK
Sending packet number 3 ...OK
Sending packet number 4 ...OK
Sending packet number 5 ...OK
Sending packet number 6 ...OK
Sending packet number 7 ...OK
Sending packet number 8 ...OK
Sending packet number 9 ...OK
Sending packet number 10 ...OK
```

Although the services start automatically, it is sometimes useful to start it manually and view the output. To achieve this, use the following instructions:

Find the Process Identification number (PID) of start.sh

```bash
ps -A | grep start.sh
```

Kill start.sh if it is running (in this example, the PID is 764:

```bash
sudo kill 764
```

Change to the install directory:

```bash
cd /opt/ttn-gateway/bin
```

Restart:

```bash
sh start.sh
```

You should see some detailed information on the gateway stats.

This can also be found by viewing the syslog. For example, when the service starts automatically at boot:

```bash
sudo sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog
```

OR:

```bash
sudo more -f /var/log/syslog
```
