## What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things is the inter-networking of devices such as smart devices, sensors, software, and other items embedded with electronics.
Connecting these devices to a network creates the Internet of Things and enables the collection and exchange of data between devices and server. 
This data can then be used, accessed and used by an end user. Although very similar, this is not to be confused by wifi. The IoT uses slightly 
different technology to achieve this. Our Iot solution is implemented using LoRaWAN.
## What are the applications for IoT ?
By collecting sensor data from "smart" devices ranging from refrigerators and home alarm systems to vehicle electrical systems and  industrial equipment to medical devices and defense systems in the "connected battlefield," 
IoT has the potential to help us make smarter, more informed decisions in all aspects of our life. Once data is collected 
## What are examples of IoT devices?
- Smart Appliances 
    * A smart device such as a refrigerator can be used to sense what kinds of products are inside it and keep track of the stock through barcodes scanning, 
     informing the user of when a product needs replenishing.   
    
- Smart Energy meters
    * A smart grid was built in the 1890s and improved upon as technology advanced through each decade. 
      Today, it consists of more than 9,200 electric generating units with more than 1 million megawatts of generating capacity connected to more than 300,000 miles of transmission lines.
      The digital technology allows for two-way communication between the utility and its customers, and the sensing along the transmission lines is what makes the grid smart. 
    
- Wearable devices
    * Wearable technology is often praised as one of the best applications of IoT. Electronic devices that a consumer can display on           
      their body have the potential to change the way we live and do things in our everyday life.
    
- Connected Cars
    * A connected car is a car that is equipped with Internet access, and usually also with a wireless local area network. 
      This allows the car to share internet access with other devices both inside as well as outside the vehicle.
      
      
- Smart healthcare devices
    * An example of a healthcare device would be the Google smart contact lense. 
      Unlike regular contact lenses, the smart lenses are made for diabetes patients especially those who coincidentally also wear glasses.
      The technology behind this innovation stems from the fact that a person’s glucose level can be measured through their tears’ fluidal composition. 
      The data is then relayed to a connected iPhone or Android app that then analyses and displays the results to the patient or relevant healthcare professional.
