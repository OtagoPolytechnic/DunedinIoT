  <h3>Oscar MacDonald</h3>
  <p>I am the server administrator for Dunedin IoT, which means ensuring the connection between nodes and the server, as well as between the server and the user. I enjoy the success of creating a solution to a problem. The entire process from learning and understanding the problem to implementing a solution is very satisfying.</p></div>
