# IoT Dunedin

## What is the Internet of Things?
The Internet of Things is the inter-networking of devices such as smart devices, sensors, software, and other items embedded with electronics.
Connecting these devices to a network creates the Internet of Things and enables the collection and exchange of data between devices and server. 
This data can then be used accessed and used by an end user. Although very similar, this is not to be confused by wifi. The IoT uses slightly 
different technology to achieve *this*. Our Iot solution is implemented using LoRaWAN.

## LoRaWAN Network
LoRaWAN is a low-power, long-range wide area network standard devised by the LoRa Alliance.
It is intended for long-life, battery operated sensor devices to communicate sensed data to a central server via one or more internet-connected gateway devices capable of receiving radio transmissions.

## Our Goal:
To research and develop an open LoRaWAN consisting of one or more gateway devices, multiple sensor devices, and a central server. All of this in the central Dunedin area, to provide access to user data for use in custom mobile/web/desktop applications.


### Current Status:
Testing prototype working, but not on the right frequencies. 

### Future Plan:
Move prototype to new hardware and onto the right frequencies. (Next semester).
